# ADBForwarder

This folk executes Oculus Quest 2 ALVR Client automatically and the execution script is as below
> am start -n alvr.client.quest/com.polygraphene.alvr.OvrActivity

Console application designed to handle forwarding TCP Ports (using [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb)) between your PC and Quest/Go HMDs, over USB

Specifically made for use with [ALVR](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR), for now. Supports the Oculus Go, Quest 1 and 2

### [Download here!](https://github.com/AtlasTheProto/ADBForwarder/releases/latest/download/ADBForwarder.zip)

## Usage

* [Download the latest release](https://github.com/AtlasTheProto/ADBForwarder/releases/latest/download/ADBForwarder.zip)
* Extract the archive somewhere convenient
* Run the program and ALVR, order does not matter
* ALVR may (or may not) restart
* You should see your device's serial ID show up in the console, if it says the following, all is well!
    * `Successfully forwarded device: 1WMHHXXXXXXXXX [hollywood]`
    * "hollywood" is Quest 2, "monterey" is Quest 1, "pacific" is Go

## Windows

If the program won't run, try installing the [DotNet 4.6.1 Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49982)

## Linux

You need to use [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)

## Problems?

Don't hesitate to raise an [issue](https://github.com/AtlasTheProto/ADBForwarder/issues) if you encounter problems!

## Future Support

Development on this has basically stopped, I got an Index.

I encourage anyone who finds fixes, bugs, or new features to manage and advertise their own fork, if this repository becomes outdated, ask the ALVR team members to update the proper wiki links for this program to the new fork / etc.
